# Robust-manifold-broad-learning-system

This is the code for the paper in Neural Network: Robust manifold broad learning system. 

Requirement: Laplacian Eigen mapping toolbox to calculate the Graph Laplacian matrix. (https://lvdmaaten.github.io/drtoolbox/)

bls_train_feng_timeseries.m is the main optimization code. It requires several parameters. Please see the reconmendation paramters in the paper.
